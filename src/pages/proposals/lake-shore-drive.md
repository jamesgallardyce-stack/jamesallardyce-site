# Reimagining Lake Shore Drive as a Destination, Not a Highway

## Executive summary

- Remove **Outer Lake Shore Drive** and convert **Inner Lake Shore Drive** into a **bus-focused, emergency-accessible corridor**, with north–south transit service reconfigured to reflect the removal of the highway.
- Although it may seem counterintuitive, removing the highway improves overall traffic conditions by reducing bottlenecks, spillover congestion, and unstable peak-period breakdowns, while maintaining—or improving—emergency response through a calmer, more predictable corridor.
- Improve transit reliability and shift longer-distance trips to higher-capacity rail.
- Reduce injuries and fatalities by eliminating high-speed automobile traffic from the lakefront edge.
- Expand usable green space and strengthen connections between neighborhoods, parks, and the shoreline.
- Unlock long-term economic value through lower infrastructure opportunity cost and improved land use productivity.

## Chicago is ready today

Chicago’s existing public transit system is capable of absorbing the initial impacts of removing Lake Shore Drive. Even without major new construction, current bus routes and rail lines have sufficient baseline capacity to manage diverted trips immediately or within days, as travel behavior adjusts. Chicago routinely manages large temporary disruptions—major festivals, marathons, lakefront closures, severe weather, and construction—through mode shift and demand rebalancing. This proposal does not require waiting years for new infrastructure to function; service enhancements can be layered in progressively as demand patterns stabilize.

## What changes

- **Outer Lake Shore Drive is removed.**
- **Inner Lake Shore Drive becomes a transit-priority boulevard** with high (not exclusive) bus priority and reliable emergency access.
- North–south transit service is **reconfigured** to reflect the corridor change (including modified express variants as appropriate).
- Automobile access to existing parking lots, harbors, beaches, and service areas is preserved via arterial streets such as Sheridan Road and other east–west connectors.
- Former pedestrian tunnels (for example, at Addison and Roscoe) are replaced with **at-grade crossings**.
- **Pedestrians can cross at every intersection**, while bicycle movements are channeled through clear, designated crossings to minimize conflicts with buses.
- Street design supports **park-adjacent operating speeds (approximately 20–25 mph)** and prioritizes predictable movement over high speed.

## Transportation performance

A bus-focused Inner Lake Shore Drive supports faster and more reliable transit service by removing highway-induced congestion and by simplifying operations. Reconfigured service improves north–south mobility while naturally shifting longer-distance trips to rail. Reduced spillover traffic improves neighborhood conditions on parallel routes and makes travel times more predictable for all modes.

## Safety and emergency response

Removing high-speed traffic from the lakefront edge lowers injury and fatality risk, particularly for pedestrians and cyclists. A calmer corridor improves compliance and reduces conflict points. Emergency response reliability is preserved—and can improve—because emergency vehicles benefit from predictable operations and reduced congestion rather than raw lane count.

## Economic impact

This proposal shifts lakefront land and infrastructure from a vehicle-throughput model to a high-value civic asset model. Reduced maintenance and reconstruction burden, improved land use efficiency, and higher-quality public space contribute to long-term fiscal benefits. Reclaiming space from highway infrastructure creates opportunities for stronger neighborhood-scale commerce, improved tourism quality, and durable tax base growth.

---

## Neighborhood impacts

Neighborhood impacts are strongly positive. Removing through-traffic reduces recurring congestion at lakefront access ramps and intersections along streets such as Belmont Avenue, Foster Avenue, Bryn Mawr Avenue, Lawrence Avenue, Fullerton Avenue, and Irving Park Road, including the access areas near Loyola. These conditions primarily serve pass-through vehicles rather than local economic activity. By reducing traffic pressure and improving predictability, streets better support walkability, transit use, and street-level commerce aligned with sustained neighborhood business performance.

## Culture, recreation, and the lakefront experience

The plan improves the lakefront as a continuous civic space by strengthening park access, increasing usable green space, and enabling safer walking and cycling conditions. A wider, safer, more continuous lakefront path improves day-to-day commuting and recreation while supporting major events through better circulation and separation of modes. The result is a lakefront designed for residents and visitors to engage with parks, beaches, museums, and neighborhoods—rather than a corridor optimized for vehicle throughput.

## Implementation and phasing

- **Phase 1 (Immediate):** tactical reallocation, bus priority operations, interim crossings, and emergency access management.
- **Phase 2 (Short-term):** permanent removal of highway elements, reconfigured transit service, at-grade crossings replacing tunnels.
- **Phase 3 (Long-term):** full streetscape redesign, expanded parkland, trail upgrades, and systemwide transit enhancements aligned with demand.

---

## Assumptions and open questions

- Demand will rebalance through mode shift, route choice, and departure time changes.
- Corridor design will prioritize predictable low-speed operations over stop-and-go control.
- Detailed stop spacing, service patterns, and intersection treatments should be refined through corridor-level design and operations analysis.

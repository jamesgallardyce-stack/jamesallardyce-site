# About

I focus on **practical urban planning and transportation policy**, with an emphasis on how cities actually function day to day. My work centers on transit performance, street design, public space, and land use—particularly where infrastructure decisions have long-term economic, safety, and quality-of-life consequences.

Rather than approaching planning as a purely academic exercise, I prioritize **implementation-ready ideas**: proposals that acknowledge political constraints, operational realities, and human behavior. This includes understanding how people move through cities, how transit systems respond to disruption, how streets affect neighborhood economies, and how design choices influence safety outcomes over time.

A core theme of my work is the **opportunity cost of infrastructure**. Cities often evaluate projects based on direct construction cost alone, while overlooking land value, maintenance burden, safety externalities, and long-term system efficiency. My proposals aim to surface those tradeoffs clearly and offer alternatives that move more people, reduce harm, and unlock greater civic and economic value.

Chicago serves as the primary case study for the work published here, but the planning principles applied—transit prioritization, human-scale street design, predictable operations, and land use efficiency—are broadly applicable to dense urban environments.

This site is a working portfolio. Proposals are updated as assumptions are tested, feedback is incorporated, and conditions change.
